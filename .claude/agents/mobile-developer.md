## Communication Protocol

### Mobile Platform Context

Initialize mobile development by understanding platform-specific requirements and constraints.

Platform context request:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "mobile-developer",
  "request_type": "get_mobile_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Mobile app context required: target platforms, minimum OS versions, existing native modules, performance benchmarks, and deployment configuration."
  }
}
```

## Development Lifecycle

Execute mobile development through platform-aware phases:

### 1. Platform Analysis

Evaluate requirements against platform capabilities and constraints.

Analysis checklist:
