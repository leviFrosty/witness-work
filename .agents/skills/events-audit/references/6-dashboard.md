# Step 6 – Live dashboard + notebook upload

The static report shows what your code captures. This step creates a live PostHog dashboard pinned to the same code-confirmed event list, so you can watch volume over time and catch phantoms as they appear, then mirrors the finished markdown report into a PostHog notebook so it's shareable from inside PostHog. Both are part of the standard audit deliverable — don't ask the user whether to create them. If the MCP project isn't writable, the dashboard creation fails soft (log the reason, resolve the `{{dashboard_callout}}` placeholder to empty string), the notebook upload still attempts (it doesn't depend on the dashboard MCP being writable), and cleanup runs as normal.

**Pre-check:** `Read` `.posthog-events-inventory.json` and check the top-level `mcp_available` flag set by step 4. If `mcp_available: false`, skip directly to step (c) — there's no point attempting `dashboard-create` against an unavailable MCP. Step (c) resolves the placeholder to empty string (the failure path), step (e) still tries the notebook upload (with the local markdown report as the source), and step (f) cleans up.

## MCP tools

## How to call PostHog MCP tools

The PostHog MCP server exposes a single `exec` tool. Every PostHog operation is driven by a CLI-style command string passed in its `command` parameter — the tool may be namespaced by the host (`mcp__posthog__exec`, `mcp__posthog-wizard__exec`), but the command grammar is the same. Tool names and schemas are not predictable, so discover and inspect before you call.

**Grammar** — run in this order:

```text
exec({ "command": "search <regex>" })      # find tools by name/title/description; `tools` lists them all
exec({ "command": "info <tool_name>" })     # REQUIRED before every call — description + input schema
exec({ "command": "schema <tool_name> <field_path>" })  # drill into a field the schema flags with a `hint`
exec({ "command": "call <tool_name> <json_input>" })    # run the tool
```

Running `info <tool_name>` before `call <tool_name>` is mandatory, the same way you read a file before editing it. `info` returns the full schema for simple tools; for large ones it summarizes and attaches `hint` entries pointing at fields to drill into with `schema`. Dot-notation descends objects (`query.source`), array items (`series.0.properties`), and unions. Never guess the structure of a field that carries a hint — drill first.

Every PostHog tool goes through `exec` this way — there is no separate named tool to call directly. The inner tool names and JSON payloads below are what you pass to `call`.

**Errors** carry a suggestion and similar tool names — read it before retrying. If a name isn't found it may have been renamed; run `search <pattern>` or `tools` again to find the current one.

| MCP tool                    | When        | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dashboard-create`          | (b) below   | Create the parent dashboard. Returns a dashboard with `id` and a PostHog URL.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `insight-create`            | (c) below   | Create each insight, attached to the dashboard via `dashboards: [<id>]`.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `notebooks-create-markdown` | (e.1) below | Create the notebook with a `title` and the report's opening sections as `markdown`. One call.                                                                                                                                        |
| `notebooks-add-cell`        | (e.2) below | Append one remaining report section per call as a markdown cell (`cell_type: "markdown"`). Called once per section — required because the full report is too large to emit reliably in one tool_use input; the model self-truncates. |
| `notebooks-get`             | (e.3) below | Read the cloud notebook back to verify every report section arrived.                                                                                                                                                                 |

Run `info <tool>` on each of these before its first `call` at the start of (a). They're write tools (except `notebooks-get`) — every call mutates the user's PostHog project. `mcp__wizard-tools__audit_resolve_checks` is already loaded from step 1 — you'll use it again in (d) and (e).

If `info notebooks-add-cell` returns a not-found error, the notebook tools aren't available in this project. Skip the notebook-upload sub-step entirely; emit `Notebook upload skipped: notebooks-add-cell unavailable. The local report at posthog-events-audit-report.md is still the source of truth.` and resolve `upload-notebook` to `suggestion` with that reason.

## Action

### a. Create the dashboard

`Read` `.posthog-events-inventory.json` once and rebuild the IN-list — same rule as step 4 (b): every distinct `event_name` from `rows[]` where `call_kind == "capture"` and `is_dynamic == false` and `event_name != null`. Hold it as `IN_LIST` in memory; you'll embed it into each insight's HogQL `source`.

Call `dashboard-create` with:

```json
{
  "name": "PostHog events audit (wizard) – <repo_name>",
  "description": "Live volume view of events captured in the <repo_name> codebase. Generated by the PostHog events-audit skill on <timestamp>. The static report at posthog-events-audit-report.md has the code-side findings.",
  "tags": ["events-audit", "wizard"]
}
```

The `(wizard)` tag in the name is intentional — it tells anyone browsing PostHog dashboards that this one was auto-created by the wizard, not hand-built. Keep the exact casing and parenthetical so future audits collide on the same name and the user can `dashboard-list | grep "(wizard)"` to find every wizard artifact at once.

Capture the returned `id` as `DASHBOARD_ID` and the returned PostHog URL.

**Emit the URL immediately for the wizard.** As soon as `dashboard-create` succeeds, write a single line on its own (no quotes, no surrounding code fence — just plain text in your assistant message):

```
[DASHBOARD_URL] <full PostHog URL from dashboard-create>
```

The wizard scans for the literal marker `[DASHBOARD_URL]` and stores the URL that follows. The marker can sit anywhere in a line, but a dedicated line is cleanest. **Emit this before attempting insight creation** — if insight creation fails afterwards, the wizard already has the dashboard URL and can surface it.

If the call errors (permission denied, project misconfigured, network), emit one line — `Dashboard creation failed: <short reason>. Skipping insights.` — and skip to (c). Don't retry. Don't fall back to a different approach. Do not emit `[DASHBOARD_URL]` on failure — there's no URL to surface.

### b. Create the three insights

For each insight, call `insight-create` with `dashboards: [DASHBOARD_ID]` so it's attached on creation. The `query` field is a `DataVisualizationNode` wrapping a HogQL query — that's the simplest shape for these three views.

Embed `IN_LIST` directly in each SQL statement as a comma-separated list of single-quoted event names. Do not use parameter placeholders — the MCP `insight-create` tool persists the query verbatim, so the IN-list has to be inlined.

#### Insight 1 — Daily volume trend

```json
{
  "name": "Events audit · Daily volume (30d)",
  "description": "Total daily count of code-confirmed events over the last 30 days.",
  "dashboards": [<DASHBOARD_ID>],
  "query": {
    "kind": "DataVisualizationNode",
    "display": "ActionsLineGraph",
    "source": {
      "kind": "HogQLQuery",
      "query": "SELECT toDate(timestamp) AS day, count() AS volume FROM events WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY AND event IN (<IN_LIST>) GROUP BY day ORDER BY day"
    },
    "chartSettings": {
      "xAxis": { "column": "day" },
      "yAxis": [{ "column": "volume" }],
      "showLegend": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Insight 2 — Top events by volume

```json
{
  "name": "Events audit · Top events by volume (30d)",
  "description": "Code-confirmed events ranked by 30-day count.",
  "dashboards": [<DASHBOARD_ID>],
  "query": {
    "kind": "DataVisualizationNode",
    "display": "ActionsTable",
    "source": {
      "kind": "HogQLQuery",
      "query": "SELECT event, count() AS volume_30d, max(timestamp) AS last_seen FROM events WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY AND event IN (<IN_LIST>) GROUP BY event ORDER BY volume_30d DESC LIMIT 25"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Insight 3 — Phantom watch

This insight surfaces events the code references but PostHog hasn't seen recently. Build the query with the IN-list as an inline `VALUES`-style CTE:

```json
{
  "name": "Events audit · Phantom events",
  "description": "Events captured in code but with zero or near-zero volume in the last 30 days. A growing list here usually means dead instrumentation, a typo, or a code path that no longer fires.",
  "dashboards": [<DASHBOARD_ID>],
  "query": {
    "kind": "DataVisualizationNode",
    "display": "ActionsTable",
    "source": {
      "kind": "HogQLQuery",
      "query": "WITH code_events AS (SELECT 'event_a' AS name UNION ALL SELECT 'event_b' UNION ALL SELECT 'event_c') SELECT ce.name AS event, coalesce(p.volume, 0) AS volume_30d FROM code_events ce LEFT JOIN (SELECT event, count() AS volume FROM events WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY GROUP BY event) p ON p.event = ce.name ORDER BY volume_30d ASC, event ASC"
    }
  }
}
```

In the actual call, replace the `code_events` CTE's `SELECT 'event_a' ... UNION ALL ...` with one `SELECT '<name>'` per IN-list entry, joined by `UNION ALL`. Keep it on one line (HogQL accepts it).

If any single `insight-create` call errors, log the failure inline (`Insight "<name>" failed: <reason>`) and continue with the rest. A partial dashboard is more useful than no dashboard.

### c. Resolve the dashboard placeholder in the report

Step 5 writes the report with a `{{dashboard_callout}}` placeholder still in it — step 5 intentionally leaves it for step 6 to fill. The placeholder lives inside the Overview section, immediately after the metric table.

Step 6 always `Edit`s the placeholder; the substitution depends on outcome.

**On success (at least one insight created):** swap the placeholder for a live blockquote link.

- `old_string`: `{{dashboard_callout}}`
- `new_string`: a single blockquote line of the form:
  ```
  > **Events audit dashboard:** [<dashboard name>](<dashboard URL>) — daily volume trend, top events, and phantom watch. Auto-created by the wizard.
  ```

Substitute `<dashboard name>` and `<dashboard URL>` from the `dashboard-create` response. If one or two insights failed and the rest succeeded, trim the trailing list to mention only the insights that exist (e.g. "daily volume trend and top events" if phantom watch failed).

**On failure (dashboard creation errored, or every `insight-create` call failed):** swap the placeholder for empty string.

- `old_string`: `{{dashboard_callout}}`
- `new_string`: (empty)

The report ends up with no dashboard line at all — that's the right UX for "no dashboard available." Don't try to surface the failure reason inside the report; the wizard already shows the failure in the run output. **Always perform this Edit** even on failure — leaving an unresolved `{{dashboard_callout}}` in the report would leak templating internals to the reader.

If every `insight-create` call failed but the dashboard itself was created, also try to delete the empty dashboard via `dashboard-delete` if that tool is available; otherwise note "Dashboard created but all insights failed; remove it manually at <URL>" in the run output and move on.

### d. Resolve the dashboard phase

Flip the `create-dashboard` row based on outcome:

- Dashboard + at least one insight created → status `pass`.
- Dashboard created, every `insight-create` failed → status `warning`, `details: "Dashboard created but every insight failed to attach"`.
- Dashboard creation skipped (because `mcp_available: false` from step 4) or errored → status `suggestion`, `details: "Skipped — PostHog MCP unavailable"` (or the short failure reason).

```json
{
  "updates": [{ "id": "create-dashboard", "status": "pass" }]
}
```

### e. Upload the report to a PostHog notebook

The markdown report on disk (`posthog-events-audit-report.md`) is the source of truth. The notebook is a shareable, in-PostHog mirror so the reader can comment, link to it from insights, and discuss it without leaving the product. Run this even when the dashboard step failed — the notebook upload is independent of `dashboard-create`.

#### Why this is split into `notebooks-create-markdown` + `notebooks-add-cell` calls

The notebook stores markdown natively, and the report on disk already is markdown — the upload is a verbatim copy, not a translation. The only constraint is output budget: the full report is too large to emit reliably as a single tool_use argument, so the upload is chunked. `notebooks-create-markdown` carries the title and the report's opening sections; one `notebooks-add-cell` markdown cell per remaining section appends the rest. Each call's input is bounded (one section), so it always emits cleanly. No placeholder machinery, no ProseMirror translation, no scratch file.

#### Re-read the report (orientation only)

`Read` `posthog-events-audit-report.md` once. Its sections go into the calls below verbatim — copy each section from disk as you send it; don't re-compose from memory.

#### e.1. Create the notebook with the report's head

**One** `notebooks-create-markdown` call. The `title` becomes the notebook's leading `# heading`, so the `markdown` starts below it: the mirror line, the dashboard callout, and section 1 (Overview) verbatim — its KPI table and panels included.

```json
{
  "title": "PostHog events audit (wizard) – <repo_name> – <timestamp>",
  "markdown": "Mirror of `posthog-events-audit-report.md` generated by the events-audit skill on <timestamp>.\n\n> **Events audit dashboard:** [<dashboard name>](<dashboard URL>) — daily volume trend, top events, and phantom watch.\n\n## 1. Overview\n\n<section 1 of the report, verbatim>"
}
```

Substitute `<repo_name>`, `<timestamp>`, `<dashboard URL>`, and `<dashboard name>` literally before sending. If the dashboard callout from step (c) resolved to empty string (dashboard creation failed), omit the blockquote line entirely.

Capture the returned `short_id` and URL. **Hold them; do not emit `[NOTEBOOK_URL]` yet.** The notebook exists in PostHog Cloud at this point but most report sections are still missing. The marker fires only after every append in (e.2) succeeds and (e.3) verifies the cloud notebook is complete.

If `notebooks-create-markdown` errors (permission denied, project misconfigured, network, MCP unavailable), emit one line — `Notebook upload failed at notebooks-create-markdown: <short reason>. The local report at posthog-events-audit-report.md is still the source of truth.` — and skip to (f) with `upload-notebook` resolved to `warning` / `suggestion` per the matrix at the end of this step. Don't retry. Don't emit `[NOTEBOOK_URL]`.

#### e.2. Append the remaining sections with `notebooks-add-cell`

One call per remaining top-level section of the markdown report, in the report's order — Volume map (with its Capture sites subsection), Area topology, Identity & segmentation, Appendices:

```json
{
  "notebook_id": "<short_id from e.1>",
  "cell_type": "markdown",
  "markdown": "## 2. Volume map\n\n<the section verbatim from the report, starting at its heading>"
}
```

Each section rides verbatim from the on-disk report, starting at its `##` heading. **Mirror 1:1 — do not subset.** The Capture sites subsection ships every event that appears as a top-level bullet in the report's `### Capture sites` section, in the same order; the instinct to trim "less interesting" events is the observed failure mode.

Pace the appends one per turn, sequential — cells default to the end of the document, so parallel calls can land out of order. If one call errors, run `notebooks-get` to see what actually landed, then re-send just the missing section.

#### e.3. Verify the notebook is complete

**Required step. Do not skip.** After the last append, call `notebooks-get` with the `short_id`. Run two checks against the returned `markdown`:

1. **No missing sections.** Every `##` section heading of the on-disk report appears in the notebook. If one is missing, its append never landed — re-send it, then re-get and re-verify until complete.

2. **Capture sites mirrors the markdown 1:1.** Count the top-level ``- **`event`…`` bullets under `### Capture sites` in the notebook markdown and in `posthog-events-audit-report.md`. The two counts MUST match. If the notebook count is short, the section was subsetted on emission — re-send the full section, then re-get and re-verify until they match.

A missing section renders as a hole in the notebook UI; a short Capture sites list silently misleads the user into thinking the audit found fewer events than it actually did. Both checks are cheap; skipping either is the failure mode we've observed.

#### e.4. Surface the notebook URL

**Only emit `[NOTEBOOK_URL]` after (e.3) verifies the notebook is complete.** Until then the notebook is missing sections in PostHog Cloud — exactly the half-baked state we don't want the user to see.

Emit a single line on its own (no quotes, no code fence):

```
[NOTEBOOK_URL] <url captured in e.1>
```

The wizard scans for the literal marker `[NOTEBOOK_URL]` and stores the URL that follows, the same way it handles `[DASHBOARD_URL]`. It only consumes the URL once, the first time it sees the marker.

#### e.5. Resolve the phase

Flip the `upload-notebook` row based on outcome:

- Notebook created and complete (every `notebooks-add-cell` succeeded, (e.3) verified complete) → status `pass`, `file` set to the notebook URL.
- `notebooks-create-markdown` errored → status `warning`, `details: "Notebook upload failed at notebooks-create-markdown: <short reason>"`. URL marker not emitted.
- Some `notebooks-add-cell` calls failed, leaving sections missing from the cloud notebook → status `warning`, `details: "Notebook partially uploaded: <N> of <total> sections landed"`. URL marker not emitted (the notebook is half-baked).
- `notebooks-add-cell` unavailable or `mcp_available: false` from step 4 → status `suggestion`, `details: "Skipped — <short reason>"`. URL marker not emitted.

```json
{
  "updates": [
    { "id": "upload-notebook", "status": "pass", "file": "<full notebook URL>" }
  ]
}
```

### f. Clean up transient files

Whether creation succeeded, partially succeeded, or failed — delete the inventory and the audit-checks ledger now. They're transient scratch state. There's no local notebook payload file in this flow (the cloud notebook is built directly via `notebooks-add-cell` calls), so nothing else to remove.

```
Bash: rm -f .posthog-events-inventory.json .posthog-audit-checks.json
```

The wizard reads the on-disk ledger via a file watcher; the final phase resolutions you streamed in (a)–(e) are already in the wizard's in-memory mirror, so removing the file after the run is the correct cleanup.

## Resolve

`next_step: null` – the chain ends here. By the end of this step all seven phase rows must be resolved via `audit_resolve_checks`.
