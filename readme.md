# WitnessWork

WitnessWork is the easy way for Jehovah's Witnesses to manage their field service priorities.

It is written in Typescript using React Native and Expo and is available on iOS and Android. Android is currently unavailable in the USA due legacy trademark restrictions. I am working to resolve this issue with Google.
