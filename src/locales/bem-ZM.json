I started working on this app when I was pioneering - I just couldn't find a clear and concise place to keep my notes. For me, it felt like I would always lose my paper notes and somehow forget my return visits. I knew a lot of other people felt the same way. My goal when creating this app was to focus on high utility but also simplicity. Anyone should be able to use this app, no matter their age or publisher experience. I hope my app has been a useful tool for you and your service to Jehovah. I have spent countless hours developing this app, and I am very happy to see it being used by so many brothers and sisters around the world. If you haven't already, please let others know about WitnessWork - it's a labor of love. Regardless if you choose to donate, I hope you continue to enjoy the app and the future updates.\n\nThank you,\n\nLevi Wilkerson",
